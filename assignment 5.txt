1.Write a query to fetch and displaythe number of students enrolled for modules on a specific date grouped by start date and display start date and total number of students.

select start_date,count(student_id) from student_status group by start_date;

2.Write a query to fetch and displaythe number of students enrolled for modules where facultyid is ‘F001’ grouped by start date and display start date and total number of students.

select start_date,count(student_id) from student_status where faculty_id='F001' group by start_date;

3.Write a query to fetch and displaythe number of students enrolled for modules where facultyid is ‘F001’ grouped by module start date and display module start date and total number of students where the total number of students> 2.


select start_date,count(student_id) from student_status where faculty_id='F001' group by start_date having count(student_id)>2;

4.Write a query to fetch and display all the modules in ascending order of module duration.

select * from moduledetail order by module_duration asc;

5.Write aquery to fetch and displaythe student’sname, their module enrolled (module name and module id). Order them according to their name.

select s.student_id,s.module_id,m.student_name from student_status s join studentdetails m
on s.student_id=m.student_id 
join moduledetail n 
on s.module_id=n.module_id;

6.Write a query to fetch and display faculty_id and batch_id which will fetchall the combinations of facultyIDs and batch IDs.


select b.batch_id,f.faculty_id from batchdetail b cross join facultydetails f;


7.Write a query to fetch and displaythe records of all the details from Student_Status and batch_info, wherever batch_id is common in both the tables.

select b.batch_id,b.batch_faculty,b.batch_dept_name,s.student_id,s.module_id,s.start_date,s.end_date,s.Afeedbackgiven,s.Tfeedbackgiven,s.batch_id from batchdetail b join student_status s where b.batch_id=s.batch_id;

8.Write a query to fetch and display the student IDs of the students tagged to faculty and all the faculty IDs irrespective of whether there are any students tagged to them or not. Hint: Use Student_status and FacultyDetails tables and Right Outer Join


select s.student_id,m.faculty_id from student_status s right outer join facultydetails m
on s.faculty_id=m.faculty_id;



9.Write a query to fetch and display the studentIDs of the students tagged to facultiesand all the faculty IDs irrespective of whether there are any students tagged to them or not. 
Hint: Use Student_status and FacultyDetails tables and LeftOuter Join


select s.student_id,m.faculty_id from student_status s left outer join facultydetails m 
on s.faculty_id=m.faculty_id;

 

10.Write a query to fetch and displaythe student IDs ofall the students and faculty IDs of all faculties irrespective of whetherthese is any association between students and faculty Ids and vice versa.Hint: Use Student_status and FacultyDetails tables and FullOuter Jointhough full outer join is not supported by MYSQL we have to find out a way to implement that.


select s.student_id,s.faculty_id,f.faculty_id from student_status s left outer join facultydetails f on s.faculty_id=f.faculty_id  
union 
select s.student_id,s.faculty_id,f.faculty_id from student_status s right outer join facultydetails f on s.faculty_id=f.faculty_id
;
